A native port of Call of Duty's single player. Goals beyond running
natively: widescreen at any resolution with a UI and HUD that scale
properly, Hor+ field of view, and high refresh rates without the Quake 3
engine family's frame-rate-dependent physics.

## Status

The game's five modules (`CoDSP.exe`, `gamex86.dll`, `cgamex86.dll`,
`uix86.dll` and `EaxMan.dll`) are lifted and linked into one native
program. It boots through the intro cinematics to the main menu with its
music, starts a new game through the briefing, and the training level
plays through to completion (played by hand). EAX 3 works through the
game's own EAX Manager on x86recomp's providers.

### macOS

Builds and runs on Apple Silicon (tested on an M3 Pro, macOS 27) with
SDL_GPU on Metal, and passes its tests. Scripted runs play the intro and
reach the training level at 60 fps (vsync, also fullscreen on a 5K
display). The training level has been played by hand on the Mac through
the obstacle course: the signs, the squad's run, the fences, crawling
under the wire and the machine-gun section, the TAB objectives, with
EAX 3 and with Miles. Not yet played to the end of training or past it
on the Mac.

## Native replacements

Each replaces lifted functions and is checked bit for bit against the
lifted original by the project's tests.

- **Widescreen and frame rate**: any resolution, borderless or exclusive
  fullscreen, Hor+ FOV (`cg_fov` is the 4:3 horizontal FOV), and an
  exact `com_maxfps` that sleeps instead of spinning.
- **HUD on wide screens**: elements anchored to the edges keep their
  shapes; menus, briefings and cinematics stay 4:3.
- **Player movement**: footsteps at any step length, `pmove_fixed`
  without rounding.
- **Collision traces**, once about 45% of the main thread in training.
- **Renderer hot path**: culling, sky clipping, texture coordinate
  generation and the draw surface sort; lifted renderer code on the main
  thread went from 12.9% to 4.5%.
- **XAnim** evaluation and updates.
- **Files**: the pk3 directory scan, zlib and the JPEG inverse DCT on
  the host.
- CPU skinning and a cinematic fix.

## Next

A renderer that drives x86recomp's graphics device directly, building
on the native hot path above.
