Quake II Enhanced (KEX engine) opens x86recomp's 64-bit path: x64 PE
images, the Win64 ABI, AVX, and a Direct3D 11 renderer to bring onto
x86recomp's graphics device.

## Status

- Both binaries (`quake2ex_gog.exe` and `baseq2/game_x64.dll`) lift with
  nothing unimplemented, and their integer (41.6K forms) and SSE/AVX
  (6.4K forms) oracle tests pass bit for bit.
- The lifted game runs from the entry point through the CRT startup and
  every global constructor into WinMain, then through Galaxy init
  (offline), the config search, the job system (7 workers), SDL2 init
  with controllers and input, and stops at `XAudio2Create`.

## Next

The remaining imports by area: XAudio2, Direct3D 11 and DXGI, the rest
of SDL2, Winsock and WinHTTP.

The repository is not public yet.
